	<h3>The Waiting Room</h3>
	<p>
Our lives were never our own.
It just felt that way sometimes.
We borrowed them from the world,
And must soon return them.
Look around and see for yourself,
People are coming and going
From this place all the time.
So when it's my time to live,
I'll give it what I can.
And when it's my time to die,
I won't complain too much.
I saw when I was young
That being alive was strange,
And it's a lot easier to be gone
Than it is to be here.
	</p>

	<h3>The Inverted Man</h3>
	<p>
The man who lived upside down,
Never knew which way to climb.
To solid ground above him?
Or to the open sky below?

Gravity never took to him well,
Said he wasn't much to hold onto.
Or maybe a distant star, too distant to see,
Had fixed its pull on this inverted man.

Because even with the Queens mattress 
Below him, he couldn't seem to fall into bed.
When November comes again, the stone in his shoe
And the trick up his sleeve won't be enough.

So grab a fistful of carpet and hold on,
Or tie yourself to the porch. 
When the house shakes it will probably
Shake him loose.
	</p>

	<h3>A Strange Day</h3>
	<p>
When the eye of God fixates on you,
For a moment. And then looks away.
When you're just a mortal man.
Your world becomes small
And you see the tip of it rushing towards you.
Like an arrow you noticed too late
To avoid, or bargain with.
The shadow of his gaze stretches out
Far in front of you, until
Every step you take is in shadow.
		
	</p>

	<h3>Love Path</h3>
	<p>
I welcome bad luck,
because good news makes me nervous.
And I got the worst of it today, that
Love is like being buried alive.
Or drowning in different versions
of yourself.
Or seeing yourself in a movie
you didn't write.
Or walking on a trail
With no beginning or end.
	</p>

	<h3>Never Knew</h3>
	<p>
In the parking lots of our lives, 
Under the overpass, 
The asphalt is illuminated
With the ideas of those we 
Never knew. 

In the gridlock of our minds, 
Caught by air traffic, 
Our thoughts are coursed
Along the paths of those we
Never knew. 

In the videos of our childhood, 
Recorded in streaked static, 
Our fears are projected
Onto the younger selves we
Never knew.

	<h3>Day After A Good Day</h3>
	<p>
I left flower tomes for you in the sky,
radiant abysma.
The universe no longer speaks to me
in feathered ellipses.
And the forest no longer welcomes me
to its dark cornered caves. 
And silver songs no longer gather
and drip from above.
The goddess is wet with sunlight 
and stretching herself out into the morning. 
Empty dawn, hypnotic lofty ephemera. 
	</p>

	<h3>Thoughts on a Goodlife</h3>
	<p>
i want to speak in
raw shimmering dream tones
see the future that is
dark and immense
let the darklight drip
into my minds eye
bathe in the pouring water
from the open palms of
a dying goddess in heat
sail through the emberhot 
network ideawire
tear down into threads
the twine that i was
sewn up into before i
was a child
taste the slippery 
effervescent thoughtstuff
and die in the silk
sheet web of bliss	
	</p>

	<h3>Poem for Chiara</h3>
	<p>
You
are morning,
and like the brightening edge of the world
do illuminate
what was once dusted in darkness.

You
are an ocean,
and as the warm wind carries a bird
do hold me
like a wild beast and a baby.

You
are the tide,
and as the moon circles the earth,
do pull me in
	</p>

	<h3>The Sewer is a Network of Rot</h3>
	<p>
Dormant in the hearts of men
are dead dogs waiting
to be cast up again
through the rot and foam
and sent forth from the sewers.

Wild packs will roam the streets
to feed on thick young flesh.
Hollow strays will tear through
the alleys and arteries
and pour out of the storm drains.

Those left will be lean and full 
of sinew and sour wine.
Their bones a different density
and their shoulders squared off.
The struggle will make you strong.
	</p>

	<h3>One Day</h3>
	<p>
One day
We will all
be destroyed
And integrated back
Into the sky--
The endless equation
from which we derived.
	</p>

	<h3>Dear Gwen</h3>
	<p>
Today was a dark day
and to it I say:
	Good Riddance.
No more waiting for tomorrow
or its brass beams of light.
Dear Gwen, thanks for the thoughts
but I'll be alright.

We wandered through 
the empty halls of our
neighborhood at night,
and you told me that time 
is a fire that left us
sifting through ash.
		...did you mean that?

These lonely days I think 
of you to say:
	Goodbye.
Someday in the light maybe 
our minds will meet.
Dear Gwen, are you still out there
in the rivers and streets?

We sat on the watertower 
and watched as the wind 
cut through the trees below,
and you said it would 
carry us above the damp
soil and into the sky.
	...that dream was truly a lie.

I’ll be waiting for a lighter day
to hear you say:
	Welcome.
Tomorrow is coming and no-
body will be spared.
Dear Gwen, you go ahead
and I will meet you there.	
	</p>

	<h3>Mallory</h3>
	<p>
The Mallard is a bird
you can only find once.
In the rubble around you it
flies and if you
flay it or stay with it
it’s all that you get.
Notice the colors
and cream and the back
of its arc.
You are now living
in the age of the lark.
	</p>

	<h3>4:30AM</h3>
	<p>
The world is spinning now, concentric 
The sun will rise soon 
And you're spreading out into the universe 
Listen to the morning birds song 
Waking, living in a continuum 
Familiar things are away now 
They will return 
	</p>

	<h3>Various</h3>
	<p>
With outstretched arms we worshiped the rising sun 
Imagined it's permanence in our own bodies 
We stood in the sand and welcomed each wave 
Watched until it receded and was integrated 
back into the ocean 
A lightness then formed within us 
Our disregard for time and gravity lifting us

- 

These thoughts and hopes are sent upward 
Into the empty void of the universe 
Released from us, given away 
But nothing is given back 
The outward flow will empty you 
For receiving nothing means you have nothing 
So clutch those drifting atoms of value 
And hold them close, for soon they will pass 
Once again left blank

- 

Someone died tonight 
But I wish they hadn't 
Someone lost something tonight 
And I understood that loss 
I channeled it into myself 
And thus lost something too 
We charted the track of the sun 
Found in its course a renewal 
Renewal of life, of lightness 
A beacon of movement and change 
When it fell beneath the earth 
We too were pulled down by gravity 
With a promise of revival 
Though now an imperfect restoration 
For I lost something more tonight

- 

We're moving so quickly now 
That the clouds all bend 
They point us in a direction 
And we went; twisting, retching 
Screaming at the sky 
Into the fire we threw all things 
Watched as they were consumed 
And returned to what they once were 
All things must burn! 
Rising up and up they disappeared 
We spun recklessly, carelessly around 
Then we too entered the flames 
And were thus renewed 
The sky was stretching out now, the clouds parting 
Making way for our ascending bodies

- 

I remember walking through the rain 
Gliding under the clouds 
Moving along hills and through trees 
I remember the feeling of grass under my feet 
Of crossing the creek and tasting the honeysuckle 
In our dugout we fortified ourselves 
And looked up at the trees 
How long had they been there? 
How long would they remain? 
We craned our necks back and spun 
And could then understand the spin of the world 
We could understand the sunlight and water 
Why it moves, and why it must move 
We saw the true size of the sky 
And could then understand our own size 
And the size of others too

- 

I dreamed that you floated in 
Through my open window 
A primal ghost-like creature 
Basic in nature 
An expression of the porous being 
An absorptive force 
And a protective one too 
You were born in water 
Raised in the wind 
That unidirectional guide 
It carried all salt, all rain 
And it carried you too

- 

Today I saw
The saddest thing I've ever seen
Our hands touched
And our eyes looked up
As we sunk into the murky depths
Your porcelain face told me
Of every event that had occured
A wild canvas of pain hope and wonder
A record of our life
	</p>

	<h3>Caught My Reflecton</h3>
	<p>
im a clear clever private pervert
in the night and im known
as something other than what i am
that is more me than ill ever be.
i have a crazy dream where
im more than i was before
and my crooked teeth would
sit straight in my crooked jaw.
i climbed up a wave that
whittled away at the world
as it slipped slowly by
so i could see the passing of time.
After assessing all ills 
I knew that despite all that is 
broken, everythings fine.
	</p>

	<h3>A New Way of Seeing It</h3>
	<p>
into the endless
channels of the sky
where we all will be torn
down into the threads that compose us
and taught what it means
to be truly alive
	</p>
