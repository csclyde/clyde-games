    "Fire is best for mortals, and sunshine— and also good health if you have it, and living beyond reproach",
    "Only a man who is wide-traveled and has wandered far can know something about how other men think. Such a man is wise.",
    "Even cows know when they should go home and leave behind the fields, but an unwise man does not know the measure of his own appetite.",
    "A stupid man and an undisciplined one laughs at everything. He hasn't learned a lesson that would do him good: he himself isn't flawless.",
    "A fool stays awake all night worrying about everything. He's fatigued when the morning comes, and his problems remain unsolved.",
    "It's a long crooked walk to a bad friend, even if he lives nearby. But it's an easy road to a good friend, no matter how long the journey.",
    "Never go even a single step without a weapon at your side; you never know when you might find yourself in need of a spear.",
    "I was young once, I walked alone, and I became lost on my way. I felt like I was rich when I met another traveler— people's joy is in other people.",
    "Where the beaches are small, it's a small sea that washes them— and so it is with little minds.",
    "You should be only a little wise, never too wise. A wise man's heart is seldom glad if he's truly wise",
    "No one is totally wretched, even is his health is bad— some find happiness in their children, some in their kin, some in their money, some in work well done.",
    "Cows die, family dies, and you will die the same way. But a good reputation never dies for the one who earns it well.",
    "Only you know what dwells in your heart when you are alone; but nothing is worse for a wise person than to have nothing to love.",
    "Men become friends when they can share their minds with one another. Anything is better than the company of liars: a real friend will disagree with you openly."
